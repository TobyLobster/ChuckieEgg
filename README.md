# Chuckie Egg disassembly

This was really done as a test case for the py8dis tool for automatically disassembling 6502, but the result is a disassembly of the BBC Micro game Chuckie Egg (1983).

Or play [original game](http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=25).

This is heavily based on RTW's disassembly of Chuckie Egg, see [Stardot forums](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=220229#p220229).
